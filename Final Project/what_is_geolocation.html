            <p>
                Geolocation determines the real-world 
                geographic location of an object. This is done by 
                generating a set of geographic coordinates such as latitude and longitude 
                through GPS and using the coordinates to determine a meaningful location.
                There are 2 types of Geolocation data being collected: Active User and 
                Passive Server Based Look Up. Collecting these data types can enable cross-referencing to achieve
                the most accurate geolocation results.
            </p>

            <p>
                Geolocation is not only determined by GPS. There are many ways Geolocation
                can be identified. They can be identified by IP address, MAC address, RF systems,
                and EXIF data. The most precise way of finding geolocation is through GPS.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most apps usually ask for your permission before they start collecting geolocation
                data. However, this can depend on which type of phone you are using, for example, iPhone or Android.
                The permission you give can range from 1 day to forever or until the app is closed.
