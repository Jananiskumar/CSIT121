    <h1>What is Geolocation? </h1>

    <p>
    Geolocation determines the real-world 
    geographic location of an object. This is done by 
    generating a set of geographic coordinates such a latitude and longitude 
    through GPS and using the coordinates to determine a meaningful location.
    They are 2 types of Geolocation data being collected:  Active User and 
    Passive Server Based Look Up. Collecting these data types can enables cross-referencing to achieve
    the most accurate geolocation results.
    </p>

    <p>
    Geolocation is not only determined by the GPS. There are many ways Geolocation
    can be identified. They can be identified by IP address, MAC address, RF systems
    EXIF data. The most precise way of finding geolocation is through GPS. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Most apps usually ask for your permission before they start collecting geolocation
    data. However this can depend on which type of phone you are using. For example, Iphone or Android.
    The permission you give can range from 1 day to forever or until the app is closed.
