        Geolocation is often used in social media apps. Many social media apps use geolocation data 
        to let users share their location with others, check in at places, and find nearby events.
        Snapchat's Snap Map is an example of geolocation. It lets users know where their friends are located 
        by using geolocation data.

        Geolocation is also used in navigation and location-based services. They use it for finding directions, discovering 
        nearby restaurants, and finding a ride-sharing service. Waze is an example of navigation and 
        location-based services that use geolocation. Waze can find your location and offer you 
        directions to where you need to go.

        Geolocation is also used in emergency services. It helps police, fire, and ambulance services locate people who need
        assistance and provide help. An example of emergency services using geolocation is ambulances. Ambulances use geolocation
        data to find their caller and provide help.
