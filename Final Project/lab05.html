            <p id="firstparagraph">
                This is my second webpage. My first webpage was called About Me. In this webpage, I will 
                show everything I have learned so far.
            </p>

            <h2>Lab 3</h2>
            <p id="secondparagraph">
                I'm going to tell you what I learned in Lab 3. In Lab 3, I learned about how 
                to decorate a website. I learned how to change the background color, text color, and more. I also learned 
                how to connect my stylesheet to HTML.
            </p>

            <h2>Lab 5</h2>
            <p id="thirdparagraph">
                Now, I'm going to tell you what I learned in Lab 5. In Lab 5, I learned about the difference between grid and flex. 
                Grid is great for multi-dimensional layouts, but flex is great for one-dimensional layouts. I also learned about media
                queries. They help determine the capability of a device.
