            <h2>1. What is the URL of the website</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.lovemeow.com/">https://www.lovemeow.com</a>/</p>

            <h2>2. What is the name of the website?</h2>
            <p>The name of the website is Love Meow</p>

            <h2>3. Who is the site's target audience?</h2>
            <p>The target audience is for people who love cats</p>

            <h2>4. How is the site organized</h2>
            <p>It is a hierarchical organization because it navigation links to major site sections. 
               For example, the navigation like Stories, Videos, Cuteness, Rescue, News, and Big Cats each contain 
               specific content related to those topics, and users can drill down into more detailed articles or posts
               within each section.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Which CRAP Design Principle does the use? Provide at least one example.</h2>
            <p>CRAP is contrast, repetition, alignment and proximity. Love Meow website has all of it. For the contrast, 
                the text is often in a color that contrasts well with the background, making it easy to read. For the repetition,
                there is a consistent use of fonts, colors, and layout throughout the site, which helps create a cohesive and unified look.
                For alignment, the elements on the website are well-aligned. For proximity, related items are grouped together,
                which helps users understand the relationship between different pieces of content.
            </p>

            <h2>6. What is the Audit Score according to the Accessibility Checker</h2>
            <p>The audit score is 56.</p>

            <h2>7. What is the site's effectiveness? Does it support users in completing actions accurately?</h2>
            <p>I think the website is effective because the site has a navigation bar that can help me get to different types of stories. Each story is well 
                organized which helps me find the story quickly and easily.
            </p>

            <h2>8. What is the site's efficiency? Can users perform tasks quickly?</h2>
            <p>I think the website is efficient because the story appears to load quickly.</p>

            <h2>9. How is the engagement? Is it pleasant to use and appropriate for its industry/topic?</h2>
            <p>Love Meow is a small business that publishes stories about cats. I think it has positive engagement.
                The website shares impactful stories about cats and kittens which attracts and retains people
                who love cats. It is pleasant to use and appropriate for its industry because it is well suited 
                for its target audience.
            </p>

            <h2>10. Make at least one recommendation to improve this website based on what you learned in this module.</h2>
            <p>One recommendation I have to improve this website is it can have alt text in images for 
                visually impaired users.
            </p>
