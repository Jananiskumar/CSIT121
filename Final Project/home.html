    <h1>Welcome to my final project</h1>
    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Janani. This is final project where I show
        my previous projects and everything I learnt so far.
    </p>
    <h2>Lesson Learned</h2>
    <p>I observed that when I tested on a web browser, I have to save it first and then refresh, or else it won't update. 
       I tested on different web browsers such as Google Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, and they work very similarly. One of the 
       challenges in this project is stitching all my previous projects together, especially the ones with multiple HTML files. 
       I don't know how to group them together as a single lab, so I decided to separate them into parts. Lab 5 and Lab 8 have 
       two different navigation bars because Lab 5 brings you to different sections of the website, and Lab 8 shows interactivity in the navigation bar, 
       which is important to the lab. I like this project because it shows how my websites have improved from the beginning to the end of the semester.
    </p>

        I learned HTML in 9th grade, but my knowledge was limited to the basics, such as p tags and h1 tags.
        CSIT 121 has expanded my understanding of web design. In this course, I learned about CSS and how to link 
        it to HTML files. In 9th grade I only learned about internal style. I also gained knowledge about tables, forms, and ARIA 
        which were new concepts for me.
