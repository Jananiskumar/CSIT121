            <p id= "firstparagraph">
                This is my second webpage. My first webpage was called About Me. In this webpage I will 
                show everything I learnt so far. 
            </p>

            <h2>Lab 3</h2>
            <p id = "secondparagraph">
                 I'm going to tell you what I learned in Lab 3. In, Lab 3 I learned about how 
                to decorate website. I learned how to change the background color, text color, and etc. I also learned 
                how to connect my style sheet to html. 
            </p>

            <h2>Lab 5</h2>
            <p id = "thirdparagraph">
               Now, I'm going to tell you what I learned in lab 5. In lab 5 learned about the difference between grid and flex. 
               Grid is great for multi dimesnional layouts but flex is great for one dimensional layouts. I also learned about media
               queries. It helps determine the capability of a device.
